      Each year, they run a segment called Surprise Teams. If you want to get up
      to speed straight from the source, here's the introductory episode for the
      2024-2025 season (segment starts at the 8:15 mark):

      If you're short on time, though, a team qualifies as a Surprise Team if:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      <li>Their preseason over/under is below 36 wins</li>
      <li>They beat their over/under by at least 10 games</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      This site just keeps track of how well the current season's Surprise Team
      candidates are doing at, well, surprising us.

      The Dataset
    </h2>

    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      The dataset collected here covers from the earliest season for which we
      have preseason over/under data, 1993, to the present day.
    </p>

    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      Over/under data was sourced as follows:
    </p>
    <ol class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      <li>
        From the numbers announced on the <span class="italic">Slam N' Jam</span
        > itself. This covers 2021 through, at the time of writing, 2024.
      </li>
      <li>
        The remaining seasons — 1993-2019 — were sourced from

      4 seasons since 1993 are not represented in the dataset: 1994, 1995, 1998,
      and 2019.

    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      Per <Link

    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      2019, of course, was the COVID year. Given the uneven number of games
      played across teams and the fact that <Link
        href="https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-regular-season-win-total-results-by-team/"
        target="_blank">bets were voided</Link
      > for that year, that season seems, reasonably, too extraodinary to compare
      to others. To be totally clear, this is not a comment on the validity of the
      end result of that season.

    <div class="flex flex-row justify-center gap-2">
      <span

        Shortened Seasons
      </h3>

    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      This dataset contains 2 seasons shortened from the standard 82 games: 2011
      and 2020.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      For those seasons, the over/under (36 wins, preseason) and surprise (+10
      over preseason) cutoffs have been adjusted proportionately to the actual
      season lengths. Does this make sense? Not sure! I majored in English in
      college, please give me a shout if it turns out I'm bad at math.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      So, taking the 2020 season for example, where only 72 games were played
      due to COVID-related scheduling adjustments:
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      <span class="text-green-200 underline">Over/Under cutoff:</span>
      <span class="font-mono text-lg italic text-yellow-400"
        >(36 o/u / 82 games) * 72 = 32 (~31.61, rounded up)
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      <span class="text-green-200 underline">Surprise cutoff:</span>
      <span class="inline-bloc font-mono text-lg italic text-yellow-400"
        >(10 pace / 82 games) * 72 = 9 (~8.78, rounded to nearest integer)</span
      >

      Icons
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">Where did the goofy icons come from?</p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      Almost all are variations on or direct usage of emoji from <Link

      (<Link href="https://twemoji-cheatsheet.vercel.app/" target="_blank"

    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-green-200">
      Almost, meaning all except the Sonics logo, which I painstakingly stapled
      together with my fine graphic design skills. It's the Space Needle! Cool!
