      What is the NBA Surprise Teams Tracker?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Alex Speers and Andrew Schlecht host "The Saturday Slam N' Jam," the
      Saturday episode of the Athletic's NBA podcast. Each year, they run a
      segment called Surprise Teams. If you want to get up to speed straight
      from the source, here's the introductory episode for the 2024-2025 season
      (segment starts at the 8:15 mark):

      If you're short on time, though, a team qualifies as a Surprise Team if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Their preseason over/under is below 36 wins</li>
      <li>They beat their over/under by at least 10 games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This site just keeps track of how well the current season's Surprise Team
      candidates are doing at, well, surprising us.
