## Additional Considerations

### KV Cache Key

Need to update our action's `SCHEMA_ID` if shape of data stored in KV ever changes

### Icon sourcing

- Emojis are from Twitter's emoji set
  - Looked up and downloaded from https://twemoji-cheatsheet.vercel.app/
  - recolored as needed
- Hourglass icon from https://phosphoricons.com/

### Cloudflare

- Semi-regularly review and update node compatibility date: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#setting-compatibility-flags
  - Setting in CF dashboard
